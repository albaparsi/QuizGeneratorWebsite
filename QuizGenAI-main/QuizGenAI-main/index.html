        Introducing QuizGen, your go-to quiz generator for any text you upload!
        <br />
        Our inspiration stems from the need for a dynamic tool that
        effortlessly<br />
        creates quizzes on the fly. As authors ourselves, we often found the
        lack<br />
        of a versatile solution for spontaneous quiz creation. In those crucial
        <br />
        study moments, testing our knowledge became essential, and that's where
        <br />
        QuizGen comes into play! Elevate your learning experience with QuizGen
        <br />
        because learning should be as seamless as it is insightful.
